# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Final Project


## EcoSphere
EcoSphere is a platform designed to help users adopt sustainable living practices. It offers resources, eco-guides, challenges, and subscription plans to guide individuals towards a greener lifestyle.


## Concepts Applied in EcoSphere
- **Usability:**
  - The website has a clean, intuitive layout with easy-to-read text and clearly labeled buttons to enhance user navigation.
  - Subscription cards are designed with a simple, clickable interface to allow users to easily choose their desired plan.
- **Responsive Design:**
  - The page adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience on all devices.
- **Feedback & Error Handling:**
  - Immediate feedback is provided for form submissions (e.g., login or sign-up), showing success or error messages to guide the user.
  - Clear visual cues like button hover effects and form validation help users understand their interactions.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Text contrast and font sizes are chosen for readability, ensuring the content is accessible to a wider audience, including those with visual impairments.
